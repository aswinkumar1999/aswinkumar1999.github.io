## Project Journey

This timeline showcases my journey through various projects. Scroll to explore the chronological progression of my work, or use the filter buttons to focus on specific categories. The central timeline serves as a navigation element - as you scroll, the indicator moves to highlight your current position.

Each project card represents a milestone in my development as an engineer, with projects alternating between software and hardware focus. Click on any project card to view more details or explore the source code where available.

Feel free to interact with the timeline - hover over projects for more emphasis, or click on the timeline dots to jump directly to a specific project.
