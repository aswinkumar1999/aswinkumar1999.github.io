I am a first-year Masters student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During my master's, I plan to focus on Computer Architecture, Robotics, and Machine Learning.

Previously, I was a GPU Advocate at NVIDIA, developing [End to End AI for Science](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/End-to-End-AI-for-Science/) material that focused on deep learning for scientific applications. Before this, I did three internships at NVIDIA, where I worked on [AI for Science (2019)](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/gpubootcamp/tree/master/archived/hpc_ai), [DeepStream](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/gpubootcamp/tree/master/archived/ai/DeepStream) & [DeepStream Performance Lab (2020)](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/gpubootcamp/tree/master/archived/ai/DeepStream_Perf_Lab) , and [Distributed Training (2021)](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/gpubootcamp/tree/master/archived/ai/Distributed_Deep_Learning), after which I joined my Full-time role in 2022. During my role, I've mentored over 24 Research & Enterprise Teams to accelerate their application on GPUs ( via OpenMP, OpenACC, CUDA, CUDA libraries, DeepStream, TAO, TensorRT-LLM, etc..) and have also been an Instructor for over 16 boot camps in the APAC region in the last two years.

I completed my undergraduate at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](iitm.ac.in), majoring in Engineering Physics with a Minor in Computing. I spent a lot of time at [CFI](cfi.iitm.ac.in) learning and tinkering with Hardware. I did my Bachelor's Thesis with [Prof. Kamakoti Veezhinathan](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/people/kamakoti-veezhinathan/) on Accelerating DCT and IDCT Algorithms for energy-efficient video decoding
