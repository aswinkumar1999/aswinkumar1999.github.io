# Project Overview:

This project addresses the challenge of deploying computer vision applications on resource-constrained embedded systems and edge devices. By developing hardware-optimized implementations of common vision algorithms and providing a consistent API across different platforms, the library enables efficient vision processing on a wide range of devices.

# Key Features:

- Optimized implementations of fundamental vision operations (filtering, feature extraction, optical flow, etc.)
- Neural network acceleration for deep learning-based vision tasks
- Hardware-specific optimizations for various platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Arm processors, DSPs)
- Automatic selection of optimal implementation based on available hardware
- Common API across all supported platforms for code portability
- Comprehensive performance profiling and power monitoring tools
- Support for both C++ and Python with minimal dependencies

# Technical Implementation:

The library is structured as a layered architecture:

1. **Core API Layer**: Provides a consistent interface for all vision operations, abstracting hardware details from the user.

2. **Algorithm Layer**: Implements various vision algorithms with optimizations for numerical stability and accuracy on embedded platforms.

3. **Acceleration Layer**: Contains hardware-specific implementations leveraging various acceleration technologies:
   - CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs
   - OpenCL for cross-platform GPU acceleration
   - NEON/SVE optimizations for Arm CPUs
   - DSP offloading for supported SoCs
   - Neural accelerator integration (NVDLA, NPU, etc.)

4. **Platform Layer**: Handles device detection, capability querying, and optimal implementation selection.

# Performance Results:
