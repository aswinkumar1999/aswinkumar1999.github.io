# Project Overview:

This project addresses the challenge of developing and testing autonomous driving systems by creating a high-fidelity simulation environment based on Grand Theft Auto V. By leveraging the game's photorealistic graphics, complex physics, and diverse urban environments, the platform enables research on perception, decision-making, and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.

# Key Features:

- Realistic sensor simulation including cameras, LiDAR, radar, and ultrasonic sensors
- Full access to ground truth data including semantic segmentation, depth maps, and object positions
- Programmable traffic scenarios with customizable vehicle behaviors
- Weather and lighting condition control for testing robustness
- Python API for integration with popular machine learning frameworks
- Data collection pipeline for creating training datasets
- Benchmarking suite for comparing different autonomous driving approaches

# Technical Implementation:

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Game Integration**: A native plugin that interfaces with the game engine to extract rendering information, control vehicles, and modify the game environment.

2. **Sensor Simulation**: A physics-based simulation layer that generates realistic sensor outputs based on the game state, including camera images with proper distortion, LiDAR point clouds with appropriate noise characteristics, and radar returns.

3. **Research Interface**: A Python API that provides access to simulation controls, sensor data, and ground truth information, with built-in support for reinforcement learning environments and computer vision datasets.

The modification was implemented using a combination of C++ for the game integration and Python for the research interface, with optimized data transfer between the two.

# Applications:

The platform has been used for various autonomous driving research applications:

- Training and evaluating perception algorithms in diverse and challenging conditions
- Developing reinforcement learning agents for urban driving scenarios
- Benchmarking decision-making algorithms for complex traffic situations
- Generating synthetic training data for machine learning models
- Testing edge cases and rare events that are difficult to encounter in real-world testing

# Impact:

By providing an accessible, high-fidelity simulation environment, this project helps accelerate autonomous driving research without the high costs and safety concerns associated with real-world testing. The open-source nature of the platform has enabled researchers from various institutions to contribute and build upon the framework.
