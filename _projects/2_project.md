title: Carry Save Multiplier Design
description: Implementation of an 8x8 carry save multiplier with optimized CMOS design techniques
abstract: A VLSI implementation of an 8-bit carry save multiplier designed using 180nm CMOS technology. The architecture features custom-designed digital blocks including modified full adders and carry propagation networks that reduce critical path delay by 27% compared to conventional designs. The final layout achieves a compact footprint of just 340μm × 320μm with minimal power consumption suitable for low-power embedded applications.
